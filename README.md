üî• This is a **PWA** ([`Progressive Web App`](https://medium.com/swlh/converting-existing-react-app-to-pwa-3c7e4e773db3)), which can be installed natively on mobile and desktop devices.

> At first, all images won't load due to [`Too many requests error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429). To fix this, keep refreshing the app till all the placeholder images disappear.
